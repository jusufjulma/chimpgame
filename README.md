# CHIMPGAME

## What is this?
This is a game which compares your mental capabilities to those of a chimp. More information coming when there is something to inform.

## RULESET:

The main objective is to click numbers in ascending order. The difficulty lies within the nature of cells disappearing after the first one has been clicked.

### Level 1:
- 3 numbers are scattered on screen, replacing white cells
- Numbers do not need to be consecutive
- When first number is clicked, the others turn into white cells

### Level 2:
- As above, but the grid is initially hidden
- When the first number is clicked, all cells turn white

### Level 3:
- 9 numbers are scattered on screen with all cells hidden
- When the first number is clicked, all numbers turn into white cells
